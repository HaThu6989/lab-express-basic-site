        <h4>Early life</h4>
        <p>Picasso was born at 23:15 on 25 October 1881, in the city of Málaga, Andalusia, in southern Spain.[2] He was
          the first child of Don José Ruiz y Blasco (1838–1913) and María Picasso y López.[14] Picasso's family was of
          middle-class background. His father was a painter who specialized in naturalistic depictions of birds and
          other game. For most of his life, Ruiz was a professor of art at the School of Crafts and a curator of a local
          museum.[1] Ruiz's ancestors were minor aristocrats.</p>

        <h4>Before 1900</h4>
        <p>Picasso's training under his father began before 1890. His progress can be traced in the collection of early
          works now held by the Museu Picasso in Barcelona, which provides one of the most comprehensive records extant
          of any major artist's beginnings.[23] During 1893 the juvenile quality of his earliest work falls away, and by
          1894 his career as a painter can be said to have begun.[24] The academic realism apparent in the works of the
          mid-1890s is well displayed in The First Communion (1896), a large composition that depicts his sister, Lola.

        <h4>Blue Period: 1901–1904</h4>
        <p>Picasso's Blue Period (1901–1904), characterized by sombre paintings rendered in shades of blue and
          blue-green only occasionally warmed by other colours, began either in Spain in early 1901 or in Paris in the
          second half of the year.[29] Many paintings of gaunt mothers with children date from the Blue Period, during
          which Picasso divided his time between Barcelona and Paris.</p>

      <div class="col">
        <h4>Rose Period: 1904–1906</h4>
        <p>The Rose Period (1904–1906)[32] is characterised by a lighter tone and style utilising orange and pink
          colours and featuring many circus people, acrobats and harlequins known in France as saltimbanques. The
          harlequin, a comedic character usually depicted in checkered patterned clothing, became a personal symbol for
          Picasso. </p>
